# Overview
Hedge fund analyst and consultant, long and (mostly) short equity. Traded traditional IPOs, alternative IPOs (e.g., Reg A+, reverse mergers), SPACs, accounting frauds, distressed equities (which subsequently went bankrupt), stock promotions, etc. Currently working on strategies/systems that use fundamentals-based signals while going back to school for more mathematics and computer science.

Outside of project repos, I also log [random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts) and [random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts). Most recently on:
* **[Random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts):** I posted a simple [derivation of the duration of a growing perpetuity](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts/blob/main/duration-growing-perpetuity.ipynb), as I'd yet to see one readily online.
* **[Random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts):** I posted a [step-by-step derivation of OLS estimates for simple linear regression](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts/blob/main/simple_regression_ols.ipynb) for those interested (e.g., students in ML courses or certifications).

I am always interested in collaborating on systematic strategies, empirical finance work (I [wrote a paper](http://www.mattialandoni.com/research/) with a former professor of mine on SPACs recently), or any interesting data project!

* Working papers / works in progress:
  * *Do SPACs Create Value*, [co-authored with Dr. Mattia Landoni](http://www.mattialandoni.com/research/) and presented to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, examines the drivers of cumulative post-merger abnormal SPAC returns. A model is proposed to quantify the amount by which underperformance is driven by "dilution" versus "value destruction". Uses hand-collected data set from original SPAC merger presentations and presents results in a cohort-based event study. Unlike other SPAC return studies, I merge a data set of daily stock loan rates to estimate a truer measure of short-and-hold returns, leading to a discussion of practical constraints faced by would-be arbitrageurs.
  * Demonstrating the ability of simple, government-reported housing metrics in forecasting future changes in aggregate housing prices (e.g., seasonally-adjusted Case-Shiller index) and exploring the main driver of the apparent disconnect between the model before and after the pandemic-era housing boom.
