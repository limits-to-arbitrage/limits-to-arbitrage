# Overview
Hedge fund analyst and consultant; CFA/CPA. Long and (mostly) short equity.

I am currently working on systematic, equity market-neutral strategies using fundamental signals while back in school for more mathematics coursework. After getting degrees in finance/accounting, and working as a traditional long/short equity hedge fund analyst, I decided to formally study mathematics and statistics to inch closer to systematic trading/investing. I've professionally traded traditional IPOs, alternative IPOs, SPACs, accounting frauds, distressed equities, bankruptcies, stock promotions, etc., for hedge funds.

Outside of project repos, I also log [random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts) and [random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts). Most recently on:
* **[Random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts):** I posted a simple [derivation of the duration of a growing perpetuity](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts/blob/main/duration-growing-perpetuity.ipynb), as I'd yet to see one readily online.
* **[Random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts):** I posted a [step-by-step derivation of OLS estimates for simple linear regression](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts/blob/main/simple_regression_ols.ipynb) for those interested (e.g., students in ML courses or certifications).

I am always interested in collaborating on systematic strategies, empirical finance work (I [wrote a paper](http://www.mattialandoni.com/research/) with a former professor of mine on SPACs recently), or any interesting data project!

# Details

### **Languages and tools:**
Python and Python data science stack (e.g., pandas, NumPy, matplotlib) | Familiar with C++, R, SQL, webscraping with Selenium and Beautiful Soup

### **Mathematics coursework:**
My degrees are in finance/accounting, but I elected to take the following university mathematics coursework:
* Calculus I
* Calculus II
* Multivariable calculus
* Linear algebra and vector geometry
* Differential equations I (ODE)
* Discrete mathematics (proof writing)
* Applied statistics

Current enrollment (Spring '24):
* Real analysis I
* Abstract algebra I
* Differential equations II (PDE)
* Vector calculus
* Probability

### **Working on:**
* Working papers / works in progress:
  * *Do SPACs Create Value*, [co-authored with Dr. Mattia Landoni](http://www.mattialandoni.com/research/) and presented to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, examines the drivers of cumulative post-merger abnormal SPAC returns. A model is proposed to quantify the amount by which underperformance is driven by "dilution" versus "value destruction". Uses hand-collected data set from original SPAC merger presentations and presents results in a cohort-based event study. Unlike other SPAC return studies, I merge a data set of daily stock loan rates to estimate a truer measure of short-and-hold returns, leading to a discussion of practical constraints faced by would-be arbitrageurs.
