# Overview
I started out in finance as a hedge fund analyst trading long and (mostly) short equity—even getting a CFA and CPA along the way. At work, the way I approached markets became increasingly quantitative until I figured it was time to formally pursue a more quantitative role—while still doing hedge fund consulting (e.g., empirical finance work, predictive modeling, web scraping).

Outside of project repos, I also log [random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts) and [random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts). Most recently on:
* **[Random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts):** I posted a simple [derivation of the duration of a growing perpetuity](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts/blob/main/duration-growing-perpetuity.ipynb), as I'd yet to see one readily online.
* **[Random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts):** I posted a [step-by-step derivation of OLS estimates for simple linear regression](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts/blob/main/simple_regression_ols.ipynb) for those interested (e.g., students in ML courses or certifications).

I am always interested in collaborating on systematic strategies, empirical finance work (I [wrote a paper](http://www.mattialandoni.com/research/) with a former professor of mine on SPACs recently), or any interesting data project!

# Details

### **Languages:**
* Python
* SQL
* R

### **Libraries and tools:**
* **Python:** Data science tools like Pandas, NumPy | Web scraping with Selenium | Data visualization with Matplotlib
* **R:** Data science tools like the Tidyverse | Data visualization with ggplot

### **Working on:**
* Reading *[Mathematics of Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)* by Deisenroth, et al.
* Scraping, standardizing, and reporting [WARN act notices](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/layoffs/warn) at the national level. These are reported by state (where applicable) and you'd be surprised how different the presentations are across states...
* Completing DeepLearning.AI's [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?) course.
* Four working papers / works in progress:
  * *Do SPACs Create Value*, [co-authored with Dr. Mattia Landoni](http://www.mattialandoni.com/research/) and presented to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, examines the drivers of cumulative post-merger abnormal SPAC returns. A model is proposed to quantify the amount by which underperformance is driven by "dilution" versus "value destruction". Uses hand-collected data set from original SPAC merger presentations and presents results in a cohort-based event study. Unlike other SPAC return studies, I merge a data set of daily stock loan rates to estimate a truer measure of short-and-hold returns, leading to a discussion of practical constraints faced by would-be arbitrageurs.
  * Testing the efficacy of yield curve-based recession probability models in timing markets, informing asset allocation decisions, etc.
  * Demonstrating the ability of composite housing supply/demand metrics (e.g., months supply of homes) in forecasting future changes in aggregate housing prices (e.g., seaonally-adjusted Case-Shiller index) and exploring the main driver of the apparent disconnect between the supply/demand model before and after the pandemic-era housing boom.
  * Short empirical note on the curiously-large, systematic overreaction to announced supplier agreements in which the (larger) customer requires the (smaller) provider to simultaneously issue to the customer warrants on the provider's stock.
