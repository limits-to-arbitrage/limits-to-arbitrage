# Overview
I started out in finance as a hedge fund analyst trading long and (mostly) short equity—even getting a CFA and CPA along the way. At work, the way I approached markets became increasingly quantitative until I figured it was time to formally pursue a more quantitative role—while still doing hedge fund consulting (e.g., empirical finance work, predictive modeling, web scraping).

Outside of project repos, I also log [random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts) and [random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts). Most recently on:
* **[Random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts):** I posted a simple [derivation of the duration of a growing perpetuity](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts/blob/main/duration-growing-perpetuity.ipynb), as I'd yet to see one readily online.
* **[Random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts):** I posted a [step-by-step derivation of the sigmoid function](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts/blob/main/derivative_sigmoid.ipynb) for those interested (e.g., students in ML/DL courses or certifications).

I am always interested in collaborating on systematic strategies, empirical finance work (I [wrote a paper](http://www.mattialandoni.com/research/) with a former professor of mine on SPACs recently), or any interesting data project!
