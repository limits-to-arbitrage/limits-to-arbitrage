# Overview

Hedge fund analyst and consultant; CFA/CPA. Long and (mostly) short equity.

I am back in school for mathematics at Columbia University's graduate applied mathematics program. After getting degrees in finance/accounting, and working as a traditional long/short equity hedge fund analyst, I decided to formally study mathematics and statistics to inch closer to a quantitative role. I've professionally traded traditional IPOs, alternative IPOs, SPACs, accounting frauds, distressed equities, bankruptcies, etc., for hedge funds.
