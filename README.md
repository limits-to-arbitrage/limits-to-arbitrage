### Overview
I started out in finance as a hedge fund analyst trading long and (mostly) short equityâ€”even getting a CFA and CPA along the way. At work, the way I approached markets became increasingly quantitative, to the point where I decided it was time to formally puruse a more quantitative role (while doing hedge fund consulting).

Outside of project repos, I also log [random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts) and [random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts). Most recently on:
* **[Random finance posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts):** I posted a simple [derivation of the duration of a growing perpetuity](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts/blob/main/duration-growing-perpetuity.ipynb), as I'd yet to see one readily online.
* **[Random general posts](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts):** I posted a [step-by-step derivation of the sigmoid function](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-posts/blob/main/derivative_sigmoid.ipynb) for those interested (e.g., students in ML/DL courses or certifications).

Always interested in collaborating on systematic strategies, empirical finance work (I wrote a paper with a buddy of mine on SPACs recently), or any interesting data project! Also happy to hear about roles in quantitative research, data science, machine learning engineering, etc.
